# ShutilCopy-example

This is a simple program that copy files from one folder into other using Shutil.copy and Tqdm.
It also verifies if there are files in the destiny folder and prompts the user to proceed or not with the copy.

It's a bit clumsy but uses some beginner concepts important to those starting with Python.
